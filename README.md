Related code from the course in Data Analysis and Uncertainty attended during the M.Sc. in Computational Fluid Dynamics at Cranfield University. The tasks proposed in the assignment are solved individually by a function named "f_taski.m" where (i) corresponds to the task number. The current state of the repository produces the figures as they appear in the report. However, the numerical values employed in it may not appear directly in the "read_data" workspace as they may have taken during a debugging operation.

On the other hand, the data obtained from the literature is stored in text files in the folder "Literature". The file should be loaded together with the functions for the overall post-processing software to work in nominal conditions.

To conclude, the visualization of the flow using ParaView is proportioned via the "3d_visualisation.pvsm" file.  Note that no ParaView plots are included in the report by the author's decision. The state file was modified using ParaView's version 5.11.
